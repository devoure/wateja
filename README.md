## üí¨ Description
>  This is a backend API solution for managing customer information in a business setting.
## :ledger: Database Design
> The database consists of 3 tables (Category, Business, Customer) and 2 one-to-many relationships.
> ![database-design](./images/DataBaseDiagram.png)

## :books: Stack
> I used the following main technologies to create solution
> 1. Python Django - Create API
> 2. Redis - Caching
> 3. Docker - For shipping code
> 4. SQLite - Main Database
## :soccer: Task Goals
1. Create working API endpoints.
	A few examples of the list of working endpoints and screenshots of the output in postman
	 <details>
	 	<summary>Get Business List</summary>
		 	![postman get business list](./images/getbusinesslist.png)
	</details>
	<details>
	 	<summary>Get Customer list</summary>

	</details>
	 	
1. Implement resource utilization.
	 Implemented optimization techniques to make the solution more efficient.
	 <details>
	 	<summary>Database ORM queries optimization</summary>
			Without query optimization the API suffers from the n+1 problem which consists of additional queries to the database that can be avoided. Having unnecessary queries to the db makes the application less efficient and a huge problem when you scale up.
				Here is a screenshot of the queries without optimization
		 	![SQL Query without optmization](./images/select_related_prob.png)
			 By adding select_related on the queries introduces SQL joins which reduce the number of queries to the db.
				 Here is a screenshot of less queries after using select_prefetch

	</details>
	 <details>
	 	<summary>Caching views</summary>
			 Caching also reduces queries to the db therefore improving performance.Frequently used endpoints results are cached in a redis database.
				Here is a screenshot of the number of queries to the db without caching
		 	  ![Screenshot without cache](./images/cacherequest1.png)
			 By using caching queries are made to the redis db which is more faster and improves performance. The cache has a 15 minute timeout where the results needs to be cached again.
